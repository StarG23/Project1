# Stock Market Prediction
This Python project is a stock price analysis and prediction application with a graphical user interface (GUI). 
It integrates data retrieval, preprocessing, predictive modeling, and visualization to provide insights into stock price movements.


## Technologies Used
- yfinance: Fetches historical stock data.
- pandas & numpy: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
- scikit-learn: Logistic regression for price movement predictions.
- tkinter & tkcalendar: Interactive GUI for user input and date selection.
- matplotlib: Visualization of stock trends and predictions.


## Core Functionalities
- Fetch stock data and calculate key metrics (e.g., moving averages, volatility).
- Train a logistic regression model to predict stock price movements.
- Simulate future price data and make predictions for future dates.
- Provide an interactive GUI for stock selection, date picking, and visualization.
- Generate detailed graphs of stock trends and predictions.
